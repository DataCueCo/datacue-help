# Banners
Banners are the most prominent part of your home page. They are typically displayed immediately above the fold to attract users to a group of products. Typically these could be:
- Product categories (e.g. Jeans)
- Product brand
- Promotions on certain products

Due to their ability to attract attention, it's very important to show relevant banners to your visitors. Let's say a man visited your store and was looking at pants yesterday. When he returns today, we're better off showing him a banner on similar pants rather than our latest collection of dresses.

# Quick Start
- Setup your e-commerce store to show main and/or sub banners on your home page.
- Upload the banners you have using the dashboard.
- New banners will take a few hours to be processed and appear on your website.
    - Note: if you delete or update a banner, this change is applied immediately.

## Main or Sub
DataCue supports two types of banners, which we call main or sub.

**Main banners** are typically the large page wide banners that are displayed right at the top of a home page.

**Sub banners** are typically the smaller images that are displayed right at the top of a home page.

Some tips
- Don't worry if you have a different definition of main and sub banner. You can upload larger images as sub banners and smaller ones as main banners.
- You could choose to only use one type `main` or `sub`
- Ensure your banner sizes are consistent to avoid layout issues on your website. i.e. If your main banners should be 1280 x 400 px, then ensure all the banners you upload have the same size.
