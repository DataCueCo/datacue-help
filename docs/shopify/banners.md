# Banners

Banners are the most prominent part of your home page. They are typically displayed immediately above the fold (the part of the page that typically requires scrolling to be seen) to attract users to a group of products. Typically these could be:

- Product categories (e.g. Jeans)
- Product brands.

Due to their ability to attract attention, it's very important to show relevant banners to your visitors instead of showing everybody the same thing.

## Quick Start

1. Go to the theme editor (`Home / Customize theme / Customize theme / Customize`).

   ![Theme settings](./images/customize_theme.png)

2. Click "Add section", then find the "datacue" category and pick "DataCue Banners".

3. Pick or upload a static banner and make it link somewhere. A static banner is shown to every visitor.

4. Drag the newly added section to where you want the banners to appear. We recommend adding this at the top just after your navigation bar.

5. Save your changes and you're done with Shopify settings!

6. Follow the instructions in [the dashboard banners guide](/dashboard/banners.html) to pick the layout you want and upload your first banners. Alternatively, read our guide on building your own [custom layout](#custom-layout).

## Changing your static banner

1. Go to the theme editor (`Home / Customize theme / Customize theme / Customize`).

2. Click on the DataCue Banners section

3. Use the 'select image' button to upload a new image, ensure you follow the size guidelines of an aspect ratio of 5:3 (recommended size is 1200 x 720 px). Then enter a link for where the user should go to when they click on the static banner.
