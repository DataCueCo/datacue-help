## Getting Started

### What is DataCue?

The best websites always shows you content relevant to your interests. This is called personalization and it's effective to increase conversion, because as a visitor you see things you care about.

DataCue personalizes your e-commerce store for each visitor to help you increase sales. This happens automatically, so you don't need to set up complicated rules or depend from a third-party to set up the experience you want to create for your users.

Get started in less than a day! Read on to find out how to personalize your store.

### No account yet?

You can sign up for one at [datacue.co](https://app.datacue.co/en/sign-up).

### Want to sign in to the dashboard?

You can see DataCue Dashboard [clicking here](https://app.datacue.co/). This dashboard allows you to manage the experience you create for your users, measure performance and learn from your data.

PS: You won't be able to see Dashboard completely until you do not select a DataCue Plan, thus having an active Account.

Recommend relevant products for each one of your visits in different pages of your website. Increase the value of your sales by cross-selling and upselling, automatically.
