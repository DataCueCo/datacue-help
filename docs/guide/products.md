Personalized recommendations

Visitor based recommendations take into account the visitor's actions to decide what to show.

1. Related to you

A section of products based on the past visitor's activities and purchases. The section updates immediately on every action the visitor takes. If this is a new visitor, we show the most popular products in your store.

This can be placed on any page **except the product page**.

Automatically select the top categories to feature based on the past visitor's activities and purchases.                                          \

**Setup your product recommendations**

DataCue allows you to choose the style of your product recommendations. You can see the different alternatives in your DataCue Control panel> Configuration> Products.\
\
**Carousel type and position:** Choose the type of showcase you want to add, and follow our [Installation Guide](https://help.datacue.co/install/) to be able to add them to each page in the desired position. Depending on your platform, this can be as simple as dragging the showcase, or adding a code.

Remember that after this, you must "turn on" the carousel at the setting section of your control panel. If your page already includes the DataCue carousel code, you can turn it on and off whenever you want.\
\
**Carousel design**: you can select the carousel layout from the layout editor in your DataCue control panel, or via CSS. If you select your design through your DataCue control panel, you can decide if your products will be displayed in a grid or slider, quantity, color, fonts, etc! You can change this at any time.
