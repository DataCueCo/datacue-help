# Product Recommendations

Product recommendations are one of the most important components of personalisation. Filtering the products you show is essential. 

DataCue makes relevant suggestions and increases the probability of purchase by analysing the visitor's activity. 

**Recommendation Types**

DataCue supports 6 types of product recommendations for different sections at your website.

\
**Personalised recommendations**

\
We create personalised recommendations based on the historical behaviour of the visitors at your website.

**1. Related to you**

We make a selection of products based on the past visitor's activities and purchases. The selection updates immediately on every action the visitor does. If this he is a new visitor, we will show the most popular products. 

This can be placed on any page **except the product page**.

**2. Dynamic categories**

It automatically selects the top categories to feature based on the past visitor's activities and purchases.                                          

We recommend to add this option to the home page.\
\
**3. Recently viewed**

This option will only appear if the user has already visited your website. \
\
**Content based recommendations**

These recommendations are based on recent user visits and are updated daily.\
\
**4. Top Products (Category page)**

We will automatically select the most popular products from the current category to save the visitor a few clicks.\
\
**5. Related Products (Product page)**

We will show products that are related with the user's interest. \
\
**6. Similar Products (Product page)**

DataCue will select similar items based on the **category, description and title** that you used for your products.The visitors will see items of their interest which will help them to make a quicker decision.  

**Setup your product recommendations**

DataCue allows you to choose the style of your product recommendations. You can see the different alternatives in your DataCue control panel> Configuration> Products.

**Carousel type and position:** Choose the type of showcase you want to add, and follow our [Installation Guide](https://help.datacue.co/install/) to be able to add them to each page in the desired position. Depending on your platform, this can be as simple as dragging the showcase, or adding a code.

Remember that after this, you must "turn on" the carousel at the setting section of your control panel. If your page already includes the DataCue carousel code, you can turn it on and off whenever you want.\
\
**Carousel design**: you can select the carousel layout from the layout editor in your DataCue control panel, or via CSS. If you select your design through your DataCue control panel, you can decide if your products will be displayed in a grid or slider, quantity, color, fonts, etc! You can change this at any time.

\
**Showcases titles**: the titles of your carousels can be changed whenever you want from your DataCue Control Panel.Â 

**Prioritise discounts**: This is quite useful, for example: when we are on sale. You can select this option at: DataCue Control Panel> Settings> Prioritise discounts. It will show to the users those items that have sales. Leave the discount at zero if you don't want to prioritise discounts.
