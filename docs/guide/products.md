# Product Recommendations

Product recommendations are one of the most important components of personalization. This is especially true when you have hundreds of products. At that scale, it's impossible to introduce your visitor to everything you sell. Instead, you need to filter and curate what you show your visitors so they can make a decision faster.

## Recommendation Types

DataCue supports 6 types of product recommendations explained below.

### Personalized recommendations

Visitor based recommendations take into account the visitor's actions to decide what to show.

#### 1. Related to you

A seccion of products based on the visitor's activities and past purchases. The seccion updates immediately on every action the visitor takes. If this is a new visitor, we show the most popular products in your store.

This can be placed on any page **EXCEPT the product page**.

#### 2. Dynamic Categories

Automatically select the top categories to feature based on a visitor's activities and past purchases. This is often used to replace the featured categories section on your home page.

#### 3. Recently Viewed

All the products the visitor has recently viewed in the past. If the visitor is new, this seccion does not appear.

Can be placed on any page.

### Content based recommendations

Recommendations that are based on the page the visitor is currently looking at. All suggestions are updated daily.

#### 4. Top Products (Category page)

We'll automatically select the most popular products from the current category to save the visitor a few clicks.

#### 5. Related Products (Product page)

We'll suggest other products that are frequently bought together with the current product.

#### 6. Similar Products (Product page)

We look at the words used in the description, the product title and categories to find products similar to the currently viewed product. This section is useful if you have many products that are similar.
