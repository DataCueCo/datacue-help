- If you use MailChimp, we can also connect to it and get all the list of customers who have unsubscribed from your emails. This ensures we don't send emails to anyone who's already unsubscribed. You will need an API key, follow MailChimp's documentation below if you're not sure what your API key is.

- Finally, just click on 'Add new campaign' in the email section and get to work on your beautiful email.
