Welcome to our guide on how to install and use DataCue on your PrestaShop store.

**Stuck?**

Just reach out to us using the support email in your PrestaShop admin panel and we'll help you get started.

## Installation

### Before You Start

Here are some things to know before you begin the integration process.

- The DataCue module for PrestaShop requires at least **PrestaShop 1.7.0 or higher**.

- Please test this plugin in a staging environment **first** before installing it on production servers. Modules may sometimes affect each other, and the last place you want to discover this is on your live site. Ideally, your staging environment is a clone of your actual production site.

- DataCue for PrestaShop syncs your products, your customerâ€™s first name, last name, email address, and orders.

- DataCue for PrestaShop also installs our Javascript library on your home page, product pages, category pages and search results page. The Javascript library personalizes your website content to each visitor's activity.

Depending on your countries privacy laws, you may need to explicitly get permission from the user to use content personalization. Please consult with legal counsel if you're in any doubt.

### Installing the module

1. Download the module

   <Button link="https://cdn.datacue.co/assets/integrations/datacue-prestashop-latest.zip" text="Download"/>

   ::: tip
   Safari on Mac OS X may sometimes auto expand your ZIP file into a folder. You may wish to use another browser if this happens. Alternatively, you can disable the `Open "safe" files after downloading` option in Safari preferences.
   :::

2. Install the module from your PrestaShop Admin panel by clicking on `Modules Manager > Upload a Module`. Select the ZIP file of the DataCue installer.

3. Once installed, scroll down to find the DataCue module under "Others".

4. Enter your DataCue API Key and Secret and press "Save" to connect your store to DataCue. You can find the API Key and Secret on the first screen you see when you login to your [DataCue dashboard](https://app.datacue.co).

   ::: tip
   If you dismissed the API key + secret screen for any reason, don't worry. You can access it again by clicking on your store name on the top right click on "Developer" from the menu.
   :::

5. Depending on the size of your store the sync process can take a few mins to a few hours. You can monitor progress by switching to the "sync" tab.

### Disable or Uninstall the module

When you disable or Uninstall DataCue for PrestaShop, we remove all changes made to your store including the Javascript. We also immediately stop syncing any changes to your store data with DataCue.

To disable DataCue for PrestaShop, follow these steps.

- Log in to your PrestaShop admin panel.

- On the left navigation panel, click `Module Manager`, and scroll down to the DataCue module.

- Select the drop down menu on the right of the module and select Disable or Uninstall.

## Add recommendations

### Banners

1. Select a banner to use as as your "Static Banner", a banner that all your visitors see. Upload a banner image to be shown to all your visitors. If you're unsure, pick a banner to highlight your most popular collection or a promotion. Ensure the image has an aspect ratio of 5:3 (recommended size is 1200 x 720 px). Learn more about static banners [here](/banners).

2. Insert the following html in your `index.tpl` file:

   ```html
   <div
     data-dc-banners
     data-dc-static-img="path/to/your/banner.jpg"
     data-dc-static-link="link/to/chosen/category"
   ></div>
   ```

   Remember to change the urls for `data-dc-static-img` and `data-dc-static-link` correctly.

   `static-img` is the URL of the image you uploaded in step 1.
   `static-link` is the link to send the user when they click on the banner. Set an appropriate URL for your store, typically a category page.

3. The default layout DataCue uses for your banners shows 2 dynamic banners and 1 static banner on one row. You can customize this by going to `Settings > Banners` in your DataCue dashboard. Read more about it [here](/banners/layout.html). Alternatively, find out how to build your own [custom layout](#custom-layout).

#### Changing your static banner later

1. Upload a new image to your server and copy the URL. Ensure the image has an aspect ratio of 5:3 (recommended size is 1200 x 720 px). Update the link for the static banner if necessary.

2. Edit your `index.tpl` file and find the `data-dc-banners` html snippet and and change the `static-img` to the URL you copied from step 1. Set the `static-link` attribute as appropriate.

### Setup Product Recommendations

#### Option 1 - Insert via CSS (Recommended)

If you are familiar with CSS, you can insert product recommendations easily by just specifying a [CSS selector](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_selectors.asp) for an element. The product recommendations will be inserted _directly below it_.

Go to `Settings > Developer` and find the **Product Placement** section.

![Product placement](./images/product-placement-en.png)

Click on the `Save` button when you're done, and we'll check your website for you. If the CSS looks ok, you'll see a green tick mark. If not, you'll see a red warning symbol.

:::tip Tip
Option 2 (below) has a higher priority. If you insert recommendations via HTML and CSS (why would you do this?), your CSS settings will be ignored.
:::

#### Option 2 - Insert via HTML

Inserting product recommendations via HTML gives you more advanced options. Normally, all DataCue product recommendations appear one after the other in one block. With HTML, you can split them to appear in different pages by specifying an attribute.

```html
<!-- insert all relevent product recommendations for current page type -->
<div data-dc-products></div>

<!-- ADVANCED: insert ONLY related/recommended products -->
<div data-dc-products="related"></div>

<!-- ADVANCED: insert ONLY recently viewed products -->
<div data-dc-products="recent"></div>

<!-- ADVANCED: insert ONLY similar products (product page only) -->
<div data-dc-products="similar"></div>

<!-- ADVANCED: insert ONLY dynamic categories (home page only)-->
<div data-dc-products="categories"></div>

<!-- ADVANCED: insert ONLY top products in category (category page only) -->
<div data-dc-products="top"></div>
```

Include the above HTML to add product recommendations to the following pages:

1. Home page
2. Product page
3. Category page
4. Search page
5. Cart page
6. 404 page

Don't worry, you can activate / deactivate different types of recommendations for each page from your DataCue dashboard.

For e.g. you can tell us to only show recently viewed products on the 404 page, but related products and similar products on the product page with just a click.

### Match widgets to your theme

DataCue's product recommendations have a default design which will need some adjustments to match the look/feel of your store. This is really important so nothing looks out of place.

### Customize recommendations look/feel

#### 1. Friendly design editor

You can customize most of the look/feel of the product sections yourself with our super easy design editor. Just play with the settings till the preview looks good to you and save your changes.

#### 2. Advanced designs with CSS

If you want to make advanced changes, feel free to use CSS directly. We've made all the elements within the product recommendation widget accessible with unique class names.
