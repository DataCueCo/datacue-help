## Pick Test Users 

Once the recommendations are ready and after you have added DataCue product recommendation carousel, you can start seeing recommendations. Exciting! 

To do this, you just need to pick a list of user emails as test users. Simply start typing the email of the test user and we will autocomplete it for you.

To see the recommendations, you have to sign in as a test user to your store. All other visitors will not see any changes.
