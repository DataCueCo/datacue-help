# Test Mode

## What is test mode?

When you insert recommendations to your store, they are enabled with a default look and feel. Most of the time, you'll want to make some adjustments to align the design with your existing theme. This is done using CSS and is easy to do.

The issue is, you don't want to be experimenting with the design on your live site!

Test mode to the rescue. With test mode, you can define a set of customer accounts on your store that can see DataCue's recommendations. To everyone else, DataCue will remain hidden. This lets you play with the design as much as you like without affecting your site.

Once everything looks good - turn it OFF and let the world see your handiwork.

## Working in Test Mode

Once test mode is enabled, launch your website in another window and you'll see that the recommendations have disappeared. Great!

Login as one of the accounts you selected above, and voila... they're back.

::: tip Tip
If you're nervous, launch your site in incognito / private browsing. This is what a regular visitor would see, and you shouldn't see any DataCue recommendations.

At this point, you can start modifying the CSS as you like without worrying about breaking things for your visitors.

When you're done - just repeat the above steps on your DataCue dashboard and turn OFF test mode.
