# Custom Storefronts
We consider your store as custom built if your store is not using Shopify (however if you are indeed using Shopify check the [Shopify documentation](/shopify/)).

Integrating DataCue with your custom built store is easy because it's an API at heart.

Our API documentation has code samples in popular programming languages to show you how to integrate DataCue to your website. To get you started, point your developer to our [Developer Documentation](https://developer.datacue.co/).
