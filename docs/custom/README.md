# Custom Storefronts

Integrating DataCue with your custom built store is easy because it's an API at heart. If your store is not using the following services, we consider your store as custom built:

- [Magento](/magento/)
- [Shopify](/shopify/)

Point your developer to our API documentation, where we have code samples in popular languages to show you how to integrate.
